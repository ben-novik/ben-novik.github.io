  <h1>Math Tutoring for Elementary & Middle School Students</h1>

  <h2>Hi, I'm Ben.</h2>

  <p>
    I’m a math tutor who works with younger students, helping them build a strong 
    foundation and actually understand what they’re learning — not just memorize steps.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I Work Well With Kids</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve spent years helping and taking care of my little brother and younger cousins, 
    and I’ve worked with children at summer camp. Through all of that, I’ve learned how 
    important patience is. Kids learn best when they feel comfortable, supported, and 
    able to ask questions without pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach is calm, step-by-step, and focused on building confidence. I make math 
    feel simpler and more logical so kids actually enjoy learning it.
  </p>
